# Worship Before You Serve

Luke 10:38-42 tells the story of young woman named Martha who, at some point in her day, found out that Jesus and his disciples were coming through the area and needed a place to stay. John 11 tells us Jesus was good friends with this family. Martha immediately accepted the invitation, and at that point, she and her sister "went into ministry" to serve Jesus.

They both wanted to have things in order for their guests, so they scrambled to make everything look great. They got dinner started, swept the floors, and jumped on Pinterest for ideas of how to set the table with deer antlers and pine boughs, candles and fancy glasses. (_Some manuscripts don't mention that..._)

Finally, they heard voices outside, and a knock at the door. Jesus, the King of Glory himself, was here! In their home! What an honor. At this point, Mary bailed on helping. She plopped down on the floor and listened to Jesus as he spoke. By contrast, Luke 10:40 says, 

_But Martha was distracted with much serving. _

Martha was so concerned about the details of getting things ready that she forgets the fact that Jesus, the King of kings, Son of God, promised Messiah, is in her living room... to be friends with her! She finally explodes in frustration toward her no-longer-helpful sister, but Jesus doesn't jump on Martha's bandwagon. He says gently, "Martha, Martha. You are anxious about many things. But only one thing is necessary."

Now Jesus isn't saying Mary's better, or that Martha is the wicked servant that gets cast into outer darkness that he talks about in other places. But I think he is communicating one major difference between the sisters that he wants Martha to understand, and it's this:

> Martha thinks Jesus needs her ministry. Mary thinks her ministry needs Jesus. 

I'll admit that in my own ministry over the past three years of Planning Center, scheduling, staff meetings, equipment upgrades, building problems, etc... I became Martha. Even when I dreamt about the future of Music Ministry, I got distracted by Music Ministry itself and ended up thinking that Jesus needs _us _to change things around Grace Community Church if he's going to accomplish his kingdom "on earth as it is in heaven." 

I quickly start to think I/we could accomplish so much more for God if:

* My budget were bigger...
* If we had better lighting...
* If the pastors would just\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_...
* If the building was nicer...
* If the stage were bigger...
* If I could just communicate better....

The reality is God does not need me. He does not need Music Ministry from our church or any other. He doesn't need our money, our lighting, our stage design. Nor is he frustrated by our foyer size, our coffee booth placement, or grass parking lot.

**Worship Before You Serve.**

The good news of the gospel is that, whether we identify with Martha or Mary, Jesus has identified with us! They hosted him for one or two nights... but he's willingly placed his Spirit in us forever!

Our musical skill and team unity now point to our Father in heaven, smiling and singing over us; Our fancy table settings and food preparation point to his delight in our enjoyment of his creation, his endless creativity, and the feast we'll share with him in glory some day; Our community with each other points to the communion of the Trinity we have been invited into for Eternity! 

**_Praise God_**!
