# Hang on a second!

In the middle of the cornfield behind our house stands a patch of timber, probably a good half mile from our house. My son Jackson, 11, loves to play in that timber and pretend he's a pioneer of some sort. He takes his BB gun, the dog, and whatever friend he's invited over and they disappear. He's built a fort back there, and I love it that he's doing something called "not a video game"!

We have one rule associated with him playing out there, and if you're a parent you can probably already guess what it is.

_Simply __tell us where you're going._

One day last Fall, Jackson had a buddy over to play and before I knew it they had disappeared. I was pretty sure I knew where they were, but they hadn't told me they were going back to the timber.__An hour or so later, I went out to look for them.

I was halfway to the cornfield when the sound of a combine reached my ears. I didn't think much of it until I got to the edge of the cornfield... and the corn was still standing! This meant the boys had to walk nearly half a mile through standing corn. There are two very bad things about this: It's quite easy to get disoriented in standing corn and end up completely lost. Secondly, a farmer was harvesting the same corn they might be lost in, which put the boys in very real danger.

At the edge of the corn field, I climbed my father-in-law's deer stand, yelled "JACKSON!" at the top of my lungs, and listened carefully for a reply. His voice was faint and far away, confirming he was in the timber patch.  _Officially guilty of breaking the rule_.__I followed that up with, "COME HOME, NOW!" and waited.

A moment later, Jackson's reply came back, "Hang on! Be there in 15 minutes!" I do not like the words "hang on." Anger swelled up in me and I started plotting all the places I could bury his body so no one would ever find it. I rehearsed the face to face chat we would have, and how he would never again forget the one rule.

I continued yelling his name, thinking at least it would help them know which way to go if they got lost in the corn. However, each time he yelled back, I could tell he was moving, but in the wrong direction! They really were lost, and the combine would be here any minute now! So I did what I think any dad would do. I climbed down from the tree stand and plunged at a full speed run into the corn. As fast as I could go, oblivious to any risk to myself, I was going to rescue my kid!

## That's what God did for us.

He saw us lost in the maze of our own sinfulness in a world where there is a very real enemy out to destroy us, and he dove headfirst into our mess on a no-holds-barred rescue mission. This is the beauty of Hebrews 12:2... "For the joy set before him he endured the cross, despising it's shame..." I understood what it felt like to "despise the shame" in that moment. To not care how dumb you look or consider your own risk... you just want your kid back!

Sometimes I get so confident in my own efforts to "produce 'good' worship" that I, in effect, tell God, "_Hang on a second! I got this!_", and forget that I'm the one lost in the field, needing rescue.

Jackson told me that as he and his buddy were trying to find their way out, they would boost each other up so one of them could see above the top of the corn to help get some direction. And when we finally met up, Jackson added, "we'd have never have gotten out if you hadn't kept on yelling."

That's what we do as worship leaders. With music, with skill, with our expressions of praise, in the power of the Spirit we boost each other and our congregation up so we can see the grander picture and regain direction for our lives as we listen to the Father's voice calling us home.
