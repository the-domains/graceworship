## Team Nights

### Why do we do Team Nights?

1. To build community. We realize that solid teams don't just happen overnight. We also realize that teams who are friends offstage make better teams onstage. So we gather once a quarter to share some food, play silly games, and learn together how to improve what we d0\. 
2. To grow in our craft. We believe all good things (including our musical or singing ability) come from our Father in heaven, but they are not given perfectly complete. We are invited to grow them through learning, through experience, and through practice. Team Nights are opportunities to study a certain part of music so we can all grow together. 
3. To stay connected. We realize that people are busy, and schedules are fuller than ever. Sometimes the only way we stop and say hi to each other is when we make a concerted effort. Team Nights are a chance to stop and say hi. How're you doing? The chats before and after Team Night are as important as what happens during. 
4. To worship. Most of the time, we are leading. This is a good opportunity to just sing together without having to worry about expression, connecting with an audience, or remembering words. 

The next team night is November 11, 6:00pm in Room 304/305 at Grace. [Click here to RSVP][0].
