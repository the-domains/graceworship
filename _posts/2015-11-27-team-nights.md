# Team Nights
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bf250fb1-3647-47a5-baac-ed3562c7ce6b.png)

Team Nights are monthly gatherings of the entire Music Ministry.  We hang out together, learn from the Word, play games, and study how to improve our skill.  These nights are not limited to only people who are on Praise Teams currently. If you're interested in being part of Music Ministry in the future, you're welcome to start coming to Team Nights. 

The next team night is February 19, 6:30pm in Room 304/305 in the East Wing.  Hope to see you there!
