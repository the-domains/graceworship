  Team Nights are monthly gatherings of the entire Music Ministry. We hang out
  together, learn from the Word, play silly games, and study how to improve our
  skill. These nights are not limited to only people who are on Praise Teams
  currently. If you're interested in being part of Music Ministry in the future,
  you're welcome to start coming to Team Nights!

# Team Nights

Team Nights are monthly gatherings of the entire Music Ministry. We hang out together, learn from the Word, play silly games, and study how to improve our skill. These nights are not limited to only people who are on Praise Teams currently. If you're interested in being part of Music Ministry in the future, you're welcome to start coming to Team Nights!

The next team night is in November...more details coming soon!
