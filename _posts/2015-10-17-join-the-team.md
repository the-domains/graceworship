**Here are the basics for being part of the Praise Teams: **

1\. Must be in love with Jesus!  This is evidenced by:

* A daily life of worship.  Spending time daily in the Word and prayer.
* Being able to share the gospel clearly with others 
* Believer's baptism. 

2\.  Must be committed to Grace Community Church as your church home. We need to love the church we lead. This is evidenced by:

* Attending consistently for at least 6-10 months before you audition. The church needs to know you're a servant before it knows you're a musician. 
* Starting the membership process. You've already attended Getting To Know Grace, and that's a great first step! The next membership classes are coming near the end of January.  
* Serving somewhere other than the stage for 6 months. _The Sunday morning coffee team, ushers, and the children's ministry are always needing volunteers.._
* Active participation in a House Church or biblical community. People need to see you picking up trash, setting the table, praying for the meal, etc. ****
