> We are always on the look out for musicians, vocalists, or technical gurus, that love Jesus and have a passion for serving Grace Community Church.  If that description fits you, then we want to meet you!

********

**Here are the basics for being part of the Praise Teams: **

1\. Must be in love with Jesus!  This is evidenced by:

* A daily life of worship.  Spending time daily in the Word and prayer.
* Being able to share the gospel clearly with others 
* Believer's baptism. 

2\.  Must be committed to Grace Community Church as your church home. We need to love the church we lead. This is evidenced by:

* Attending consistently for at least 6-10 months before you audition. The church needs to know you're a servant before it knows you're a musician. 
* Starting the membership process.  We want you to commit to our church; to attend regularly, to contribute to the life of the body, to willingly put yourself under the authority of our leaders, etc.  The first step is our Getting To Know Grace lunch  
* Serving somewhere other than the stage for 6 months. _The Sunday morning coffee team, ushers, and the children's ministry are always needing volunteers.._
* Active participation in a House Church or biblical community. People need to see you picking up trash, setting the table, praying for the meal, etc. ****
