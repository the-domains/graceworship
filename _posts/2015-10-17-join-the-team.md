# CAN I JOIN THE TEAM?

If you have ever wondered what steps are required to be part of the Grace Praise Teams, you've come to the right place. 

* _Step 1_ // **Fill out an application**.  Applications are located in the main church office, or at the sound booth back of the auditorium. Completed forms can be turned in to the front desk at the church office.  
* _Step 2_ // We'll schedule a face-to-face meeting for **coffee**, so we can meet you and you can meet us!  (PS the coffee is on us!)

* _Step 3_ // **Auditions**. For some folks this is where the scary starts, but it's a helpful way to to gauge what you are bringing to the table.  We don't have Simon Cowell with us, so we promise you're not going to go home crying because of us!  
* _Step 4_ // You're in! Music Ministry is like a family.  We love to play music together, but we also gather regularly just to hang out, and we also meet on month Team Nights where we encourage each other, pray for each other, and improve our skills.
