First of all, thank you for wanting to be a part of the team! 

The first step is for you to fill out a Praise Team Application. These are available before and after services in the sound booth located at the NorthEast side of the auditorium. Just ask the sound tech, presenter, or the praise team leader that day, and they'll get it for you. You can return it to the sound booth or to Rodney as well. 

The second step is to schedule an audition. One of our team will get in touch with you about what is needed for your audition. 

Lastly, the audition team will be in touch with you with the next steps! Thanks again!
