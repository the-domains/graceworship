If you're interested in being part of the Praise Team here at Grace, it's a fairly simple process.

**Worship before Service.** Remember the story of Mary and Martha in Luke 10? Scripture says Martha was busy with "much serving", while Mary sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. When Martha got upset, Jesus told her that Mary chose what was better. 

We aren't looking for musicians and singers. _We are looking for worshipers. _
