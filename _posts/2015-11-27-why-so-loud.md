# Why So Loud?

From time to time, people come up to me and they say, "Why does the music have to be so loud?"  I'll assure you that I take every one of these questions seriously.  None of us on the team are looking to blow anyone's eardrums out, so if someone is brave enough to ask, we are too.  We always turn around and ask a few other people (non-staff, non-musical) and get a second opinion. If they agree, we turn it down. If they say it's fine, we get a third. 

All that to say, if you think it's too loud... talk to us!  We'd love to hear feedback (from you, not the microphones!) so we can continue to refine what we do on Sunday mornings.
