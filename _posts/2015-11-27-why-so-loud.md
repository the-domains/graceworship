# Why is the music so loud?

From time to time, I hear comments floating around to the tune of, "Why does it have to be so loud?"  This is a completely reasonable question, and one that I take very seriously. 

First of all, none of us are looking to blow anyone's eardrums out. Volume is definitely something we are very aware of at Grace and are consistently trying to navigate well.  A few things we are doing to help with sound:

* _We are currently in the process of building and installing acoustic sound panels around the auditorium to help deaden the noise.  _
* _We are currently looking to provide all musicians and singers with in-ear monitors, which will take 5-6 loudspeakers off stage, greatly reducing the overall stage volume.  _

The tough part is that the "ideal" volume level is subjective, and relies largely on preference and the sensitivity of the worshipers ears. 

# 

# The Facts

Music at our services, when there's a full band, can occasionally peak at 95-98dB, although our target is 90-92\. According to OSHA standards, a volume level of 95dB can be sustained for up to four hours before there is any hearing loss. At Grace, a typical service is 65 minutes with a 40-45 minute sermon. So rest assured,**no matter how loud it seems in the room, your hearing is never in danger.**

For the sake of comparison

* Rock concerts usually are 110-115dB
* When the Hawkeyes score a touchdown, the stadium can easily reach 115dB. _No one asks their seat neighbor to cheer quieter because they "can't hear themselves cheer." _

If you're running a kitchen blender, mowing your lawn, holding a crying baby, your ears are exposed to 95-115dB of noise.

* Driving your car with the windows down? 85dB.  With the radio cranked? 95dB.  For this reason, I implore you to not drive with your windows down on the highway.  If you're doing that for more than 3o minutes at a time, you're permanently damaging your hearing! 

Now one could ask, "What does the Bible have to say about it?" and here's where I get excited!  

Psalm 33:3 - Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with **loud** shouts.

Psalm 150:6 - Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with **loud clashing cymbals**!

1 Chronicles 15:16

All that to say, if you think it's too loud... talk to us!  We'd love to hear feedback (from you, not the microphones!) so we can continue to refine what we do on Sunday mornings. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/392c87a1-e03e-49db-bce4-ad34f28aa095.jpg)
