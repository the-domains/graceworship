# Request.

We live in an amazing time, when it comes to music. Computers come with free software that makes producing decent music very easy. As a result, music is everywhere!  This is fantastic, but when it comes to Church music, there's a big difference between a song you want to crank up in your car, and a song that's singable for a congregation people with differing musical tastes.

So, from a worship leader perspective, taking requests is difficult.  I enjoy hearing what kind of songs you connect with, but it's rare that songs we hear on the radio are singable for a congregation. So I usually smile and nod, and then tuck it away in my mind.  But that's not fair to you who go out of your way to make a suggestion of a song you really like and want others to experience. 

With that in mind, I've developed a bit of a filter you can run your favorite song through to see if it would fit as a congregational song. 

## The song must be:

1\. **Easy to learn**.  We have at Grace a tremendous blessing in that we are very age-diverse. There are a lot of young families, and young professionals, but there are also a lot of grandparents and retired-age attenders. This is fantastic! But we need to be aware of that when choosing new songs.  So, to test if a song should be sung on Sundays, how many times did you have to hear it before you started singing along? 

__

Good: 2-3 times. Better: 1-2 times. Best: Singing along before the song ended.

_Consider: A good rule of thumb when I'm picking new songs, is I try to picture my grandparents singing it... would they be able to sing any part of it to my kids later that afternoon? Would they even want to?_

**2\. Memorable.  **What I'm looking for here is something you can take with you after the song is over.  A lyric or melody that stands out and comes back to mind when you're standing by the hospital bed of a loved one, or when you're reading Scripture.  Musicians call this a "hook"... something that sticks. Sometimes the hook is found in the melody. Sometimes it's in a lyric. Sometimes its in the instrumentation.  No matter where it is, it's there to help you remember the song. If the song has no hook, it's a lot more difficult to recall the next time it's sung or to sing by memory.

3\. **Theologically Accurate.** This is the toughest one of the checklist.  Sometimes a song is explicitly the gospel, for example, _All I Have Is Christ_, or _In Christ Alone, _who's authors intended to communicate the gospel in one song.  Sometimes, the gospel is implied or assumed, for example, _You make all things work together for my good _or _I'm loved by you__, it's who I am.  _Those aren't inaccurate lyrics, but they mean we either have to assume the listener knows how it fits into the gospel, or the leader has to explain.  Sometimes the song sounds like it's written to a boyfriend instead of the King of kings. 

Some lyrics are just flat wrong. For example, "_like a rose, trampled on the ground, You took the fall and thought of me above all_."  The problem with that, is that while Jesus was on the cross, he was NOT thinking of you _above all. _ He said "It Is Finished."  He said, to fulfill Scripture, "I thirst."  He was thinking about the Father's plan and how his death would magnify and glorify God. You were on his mind (Galatians 2:20), but certainly not above glorifying himself and the Father. 

Remember our songs support in the inerrancy of Scripture. Colossians 3:16 says we should "let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.... as we sing..."  This is \#3 on the new song checklist, but is of maximum importance.  

_Consider: Do the lyrics fit the theology of Grace Community Church? Is this explicit or implied? Could you locate the Scripture that the song supports? _

4\.**Meaningful.  **Why do you like the song you're recommending? Did it help you through a difficult time in life?  Does it bring to mind the gospel through which you are encouraged to run the race well?  Or is it just a cool song you like to jam to in your car?

5\. **Doable****without a band.** This is the least important of the five, but is still a good thing to keep in mind.  Does this song work without drums? Without a piano? Without an electric guitar?  Does it work without an energetic crowd, or a loudspeaker system?  Does it work without a "professional" guitar player, or worship leader? 

_Consider: A lot of House Churches take the songs we sing on Sunday mornings and sing them in their living rooms. _

## Conclusion.

The best church songs are songs that can be sung with or without instruments, by the hospital bed, or around the campfire, on stage at a concert, or at House Church in your living room. They are the songs that support and magnify Scripture's effort to make much of Christ, but are easy to learn and memorable. 

That's a pretty tall order for songwriters for sure, so we are always grateful and excited when we find songs that fit these qualifications!
