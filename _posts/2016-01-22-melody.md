# Request a song.

We live in an amazing time, when it comes to music. Computers come with free software that makes producing decent music very easy. As a result, music is everywhere! This is fantastic, but when it comes to Church music, there's a big difference between a song you want to crank up in your car, and a song that's singable for a congregation people with differing musical tastes.

I get a lot of requests (which is awesome! Keep them coming), but so you can see where I'm coming from when I pick songs, I'm showing you the filter you can run your favorite song through to see if it would fit as a congregational song. 

## The song must be:

1\. **Easy to learn**. How many times did you have to hear it before you started singing along? There are a few exceptions to this rule, but in general, use this as a gauge:

__

* Good: 2-3 times. 
* Better: 1-2 times. 
* Best: Singing along before the song ended.

_Consider: A good rule of thumb when I'm picking new songs, is I try to picture my parents singing it... would they be able to sing any part of it to their grandchildren later that afternoon? Would they even want to?_

**2\. Memorable. **What I'm looking for here is something you can take with you after the song is over; something that will stick in your head when you think about "that new song". This makes it easier to remember the next time we sing it, or if you're wanting to lead it at your House Church. 

3\. **Theologically Accurate.** The most important of the five criteria, congregational songs should support the inerrancy of Scripture. Colossians 3:16 says we should "let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.... as we sing..." Print off the lyrics to the song, and read them out loud. Do they still move you when there is no music attached? Do the lyrics fit the theology of Grace Community Church? Is this explicit or implied? Could you locate the Scripture that the song supports? 

4\.**Meaningful. **Why do you like the song you're recommending? Did it help you through a difficult time in life? Does the song have a specific purpose (communion, baptism, sending missionaries, enduring suffering, heaven/eternity)? Is there a specific attribute of God that it highlights? 

5\. **Doable****without a band.** This is the least important of the five, but is still a good thing to keep in mind. Would the song work without drums? Would someone who's not proficient on guitar or piano be able to play it for House Church, youth group, or around a campfire? 

_Consider: A lot of House Churches take the songs we sing on Sunday mornings and sing them in their living rooms. Is this a song that would work in that setting?_

## Conclusion.

The best church songs are songs that magnify and turn our attention to God's glory, as revealed in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. A lot of songs attempt to do just that, but aren't memorable, easy to sing, or easy to play. Some songs are easy to sing, play, and remember, but don't magnify the person, Jesus. 

It's a tall order for songwriters for sure, so we are always grateful and excited when we find songs that fit all five qualifications! 

_Please email me at: rodneyg@graceb3.org if you want to recommend a song, or if you want my opinion on a song you are leading at your House Church or youth group. I'd love to hear from you! _
