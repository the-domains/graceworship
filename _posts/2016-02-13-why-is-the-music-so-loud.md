# Why is the music so loud?

This is a completely reasonable question, and one we take very seriously. First of all, none of us are looking to blow anyone's eardrums out, or to be loud just for the sake of being loud. Volume is something we are consistently trying to refine and navigate well. A few projects we are currently working on to improve the sound at Grace:

* _We recently installed acoustic sound panels around the auditorium to help deaden the noise._
* _We are looking to provide all musicians and singers with in-ear monitors, which will take 5-6 loudspeakers off stage, greatly reducing the overall stage volume. ($6,000-10,000)_

The tough part is that the "ideal" volume level is subjective, and relies largely on preference and the sensitivity of the worshipers ears. 

# The Facts

Volume is most often measured in decibals (dB). This gives an overall measurement of the volume, but sometimes it's not even the overall volume that's the problem, and the culprit is a certain frequency that can be harsh.

Music at our Sunday morning services, when there's a full band, occasionally peaks at 95-98dB, although our target is 88-92\. According to OSHA standards, a volume level of 95dB can be sustained for up to four hours before there is any permanent hearing loss. At Grace, a typical service is 65 minutes with a 40-45 minute sermon. So rest assured that no matter how loud it seems in the room, your hearing is not in danger.

For the sake of comparison:

* Average conversation happens around 65dB.
* Rock concerts usually run 110-115dB
* Driving your car with the windows down? 85dB. With the radio cranked? 95dB. 
* A baby's cry can easily be over 100dB. 
* When the Hawkeyes score a touchdown, the stadium can easily reach 115dB.

95% of the time, volume is just personal preference and desired experience. For example, a concert or a football game would be pretty lame if it didn't get loud! That's part of the experience. On Sunday mornings, our target is the music is loud enough to be energetic, but quiet enough that you can hear other voices.

Now one could ask, "What does the Bible have to say about it?" and here's where I get excited! 
> 
> Psalm 33:3 - Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with **loud **shouts.

> Psalm 150:6 - Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with **loud clashing cymbals**!

The Bible doesn't say our praise HAS to be loud, but it sure sounds like it should be! 

All that to say, if you still think it's too loud... talk to us! We'd love to hear feedback so we can continue to refine what we do on Sunday mornings.
