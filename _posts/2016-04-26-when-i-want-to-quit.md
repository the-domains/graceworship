# When I Want To Quit

![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b0b7eaa7-4ae0-4d89-b225-0756180b2e31.jpg)

I've been leading worship since I was 15\. I've wanted to be a full-time worship leader since I was 17 or 18\. In that sense, I'm living my dream. I really do enjoy my job and I look forward to coming to work every day, but I'm going to let you behind the doors for a moment.

__

_Sunday afternoons can be brutal. _

I spend a lot of them recalling every word I said that morning could have been said better, even things I prayed that I felt I left unclear or even theologically confusing, every call to worship that I DIDN'T do. I often doubt my preparation. I fight the stares of people I know are more theologically astute than me, feeling like they are critiquing every word I say and every song choice. I fight the stares of people who don't want to be there, as if they are saying, "I DARE you to try to move me" and sometimes those people are my friends! I fight the feeling that the Praise Team behind me onstage think there's someone else who could be doing a better job. And at the end of the service, I often walk off the stage out the back doors and wonder why we try so hard when all we get back is blank stares and yawns in-between sips of coffee. 

I would guess some of you have had similar feelings at times.

But without fail, I hear the Spirit whisper into my pity party,

> Worship isn't about you, Rodney. Your job is to set the table. It's my job to make people want to eat.

## Setting The Table

Twenty-one years into this, I feel smaller and more insignificant every time I lead. The more I do this, the more I realize that there is nothing I can do to change or even move someone's heart. We can hit everything just right... the call to worship, a gospel-intense Scripture reading, powerful and emotionally moving songs, lyrics right on time, sound perfectly mixed/EQ'd/layered, tight musically and vocally... and still, yawns and sips and stares. 

Now, to be sure, there are things we can do to distract people's attention from God. We have a MASSIVE responsibility as leaders onstage and in the A/V booth. Music too loud or too quiet, lyrics not changing quickly enough or misspelled, a careless word from the microphone, an annoyed glance at a musician's mistake, an article of clothing that catches the eye... all of these things can pirate people's attention from where it should be. We should, and will, continue to make every effort to eliminate distractions by pursuing excellence in all areas, but we have to let the heart-changing up to the Holy Spirit. 

After repenting of my little pity parties on Sunday afternoons and a day or two of letting the Spirit renew my mind (Romans 12:2), by the time next Sunday morning comes around, there is literally no other place in the world I'd rather be than singing and making music with people I love, for a church I love, praising and worshiping the God who knows more about rejection and blank stares than I ever will, and yet loves us anyway. 

So, here's my invitation to you: Let's set the table as best we can. Make it look good. Make it inviting. Point our church family and our guests to the delicious Word of God, his son Jesus.
