description: '"Worship the Lord with gladness. Come before him, singing with joy." (Psalm 100:2 NLT, second edition) To strengthen your faith, you must unite with others in worship. Worship is for God, but it also has benefits for you. Here are two of the biggest benefits of corporate worship: It renews your faith, and it restores your joy.'
