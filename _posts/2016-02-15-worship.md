> Worship is initiated by God. It is not the grand idea of man; it did not begin with man. It is a response to God. God was always there first. The response to God is always prompted by the previous activity or presence of God. There is no man that has ever found God, as though God were lost. God was always there waiting, calling. In the thought of Francis Thompson in "The Hound of Heaven," God is seeking, searching, pursuing mankind. It is God's initiative to which we respond. It is God who draws us to Himself. It belongs to the essence of worship that it is a response to God.
