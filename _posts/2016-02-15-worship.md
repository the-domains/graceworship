# Worship 

We believe that worship is not an adjective used to describe a gathering of people (worship service), or a genre of music. Worship is a verb which describes the continuous outpouring of our hearts toward something, or someone we value most. 

We believe Christian worship is defined as "The appropriate response, through the Spirit, to what God has done for us in Christ's life, death, and resurrection." It is the offering of ourselves, body, soul, and mind (Romans 12:1,2), and encompasses all areas of life... our finances, relationships, vocation, recreation, education, family life, etc.

Lastly, we believe that, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the central object, the mediator, and the perfecter of our worship; that he continues, as our Great High Priest, to intercede to the Father on our behalf.
