# Details

Did you know that God is very detailed? He is, and it is one his amazing graces to us as believers, meant to inspire faith in him, which in turn brings him glory. Here's how we know that: 

• **Some details reveal his power**. Isaiah 40:26 says, 
> 
> "Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing." 

That is one of my favorite verses in Scripture. _Not one star is missing or nameless. _Let's be real here... 100 trillion stars don't all need names. Maybe just the big ones.  

• **Some details reveal His nearness.  **Psalm 139:2, 3

> You discern my thoughts from afar__. You are acquainted with all my ways.

God not only knows my thoughts, but he knows my habits, my weaknesses, my behavioral patterns, what gets me riled up as well as the things I enjoy. And he knows how many hairs are on my head (Luke 12:7). 

• **Some details are proof that He has a plan**.  John 19:28-30 says, 
> 
> "After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (**to fulfill the Scripture), **'I thirst.' A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. When Jesus has received the sour wine, he said, 'It is finished,' and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."

_Hello._

In that last verse, Jesus is hanging on the cross in excruciating agony; His body lacerated by whips, his head punctured by giant splinters, nails through his hands and feet, and he asks for a drink. The soldiers oblige his request and, unbeknownst to them, help him fulfill the last detail of the plan that Scripture spoke about so many years before in Psalm 22\. "I thirst."

**Detailed plan: Complete**

## The good news.

So why do these little details matter? Why does it matter if God knows the names of stars, knows how many hairs are on your head, or that he asked for a drink on the cross?

Because you can move forward in your life with full assurance that Jesus does not leave details out of your story! Every moment of our lives is marked by his grace and provision.

Even the times we think life is out of control and that he can't possibly have a plan for making it all work out, we can know that his plan for us is well thought out and that even the smallest detail will not be left out!

**Whether or not you know what you'll be doing in 5 years**... God has a detailed plan to help you trust him.

**When your house church or ministry feels dysfunctional**... God has a detailed plan for your leadership development and for your community.

**When it feels like your kids are turning on you**... God has a detailed plan for their lives to give them the best possible opportunity to know him, and again, for you to trust him.

**When your neighbor or a family member makes your life difficult**... God has a detailed plan for your sanctification.

**When you were completely helpless and dead in your sin**... God put in motion an extremely detailed plan for your redemption, and we know, because he asked for a drink on the cross, that He will not leave anything out! //
