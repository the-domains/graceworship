            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1></h1><p>Team Nights are monthly gatherings of the entire Music Ministry.  We hang out together, learn from the Word, play games, and study how to improve our skill.  These nights are not limited to only people who are on Praise Teams currently. If you're interested in being part of Music Ministry in the future, you're welcome to start coming to Team Nights. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b650bb09e5fdcc432dca3803136dc01ce4652ce6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Why So Loud?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why So Loud?</h1><p>From time to time, people come up to me and they say, "Why does the music have to be so loud?"  I'll assure you that I take every one of these questions seriously.  None of us on the team are looking to blow anyone's eardrums out, so if someone is brave enough to ask, we are too.  We always turn around and ask a few other people (non-staff, non-musical) and get a second opinion. If they agree, we turn it down. If they say it's fine, we get a third. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/154bb095-ef7f-4788-badc-a3b8337a43e5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
