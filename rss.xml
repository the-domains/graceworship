            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Request.</h1><p>We live in an amazing time, when it comes to music. Computers come with free software that makes producing decent music very easy. As a result, music is everywhere!  This is fantastic, but when it comes to Church music, there's a big difference between a song you want to crank up in your car, and a song that's singable for a congregation people with differing musical tastes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5e706d95bd41a068b64b6b0e1dea93fbde36e249.jpg"></article>]]></description>
