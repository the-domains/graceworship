            <title><![CDATA[Worship Before You Serve]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Worship Before You Serve</h1><p>Luke 10:38-42 tells the story of young woman named Martha who, at some point in her day, found out that Jesus and his disciples were coming through the area and needed a place to stay. John 11 tells us Jesus was good friends with this family. Martha immediately accepted the invitation, and at that point, she and her sister “went into ministry” to serve Jesus.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0fda39b3ffac93d3db5626446cec93cf66bed6cf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Posture Matters in Worship:</h1><p>Growing up, I was Michael Jordan's biggest fan. I regularly wrote him to ask for his autograph and invite him to my birthday parties.
